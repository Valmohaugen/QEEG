A - Dataset/Resource gathering - Khloud, Sultan
1. Find papers with benchmarks, for classification tasks.
  1. b) Look for datasets with more classes with poor classical performance
2. Add github codes/results from this papers.


B - Implementing algorithm - Val, Douaa, Yousra, Chantelle, Tushar
3. One type of disorder (decide/fix the dataset) and one type of quantum algorithm (QSVM) for multi-label classification
 3.b) Try simulators and then real hardwares


<!-- For understanding of the paper/algorithm functionality - Tushar, Yousra -->
4. As a prerequisite - Read more about SVMs (add some links/references here)
 4. b) Read about QSVM - need to understand circuit part.


C - Future work
5. Recommendation system - Later depending on dataset and time.
6. QSVR
7. QSVM augmented with classical NN for multi-label classification




Timeline - 
Week 1: Finding data/resources
Week 2: Implementing the algorithm
Week 3: Polishing the paper/overleaf document
